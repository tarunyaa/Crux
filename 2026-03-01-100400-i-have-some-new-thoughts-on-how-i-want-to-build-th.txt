  benchmarks to see what works                                              
                                                                            
  Idea #1: Individual agents belief/epistemic graphs                        
  Paper Inspiration: Simulating Society Requires Simulating Thought         
  When the topic of the debate is provided? Or should this be done during   
  the persona card creation?                                                
  Parse tweets/substack articles to form causal directed acyclic graphs     
  that represent that individual’s belief structure                         
  Visually, looks like the graphs in Obsidian                               
  Each node is a cognitive motif and edges encode a directional causal      
  relation with confidence and polarity scores.                             
  Reasoning in a form of forward inference over the belief graph.           
  Probabilistic updates are used to simulate belief revision.               
  There can be weak or isolated nodes.

  Some sort of forward inference to generate reasoning traces               
                                                                            
  Convert belief graphs to personalized reasoning chains and having agents  
  argue in text, then convert the arguments back into some sort of          
  graphical representation                                                  
                                                                            
  Use LLM+Argumentative framework papers to create a disagreement           
  compression engine based on text

  Enhancing conflict resolution in language models via abstract             
  argumentation

  Idea #2: Latent belief states                                             
  Converting belief graphs to latent belief states and have agents update   
  beliefs in that space                                                     
  Collaborative latent belief space?                                        
                                                                            
  Paper inspiration:                                                        
  Belief States for Cooperative Multi-Agent RL under Partial Observability  
  From Debate to Equilibrium: Belief-Driven Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning via   
  Bayesian Nash Equilibrium                                                 
                                                                            
  Need to understand these papers better                                    
                                                                            
  Idea #3: Minimal community debate graph                                   
  Individual belief graphs, each common node and edge compete with each     
  other to create a minimal community debate belief graph - all the beliefs 
   they can agree on after clashes?                                         
   - spin up different research agent - an agent for benchmarks, idea 1, 2, 
   3 and any other agents needed. explore every aspect of this thoroughly.  
  agents should talk to each other and synthesize their findings to create  
  3_1_exploration.md in /docs which is short, concise, coherent response to 
   my new thoughts- i want to know how to go forward in this direction and  
  structure the approach. feel free to criticize, probe new directions.     

● I'll set up a research team to explore all of these ideas in parallel. Let me
  first check your existing docs for context, then spin up the agents.

● Searched for 1 pattern, read 3 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good context gathered. Let me set up a research team to explore all your ideas
   in parallel.

● Now let me spawn the research agents. The first three can run in parallel, and
   the fourth (synthesis) will wait for them.

● 3 agents launched (ctrl+o to expand)
   ├─ @benchmarks-researcher (research-analyst)
   │  ⎿  Research debate benchmarks
   ├─ @belief-graphs-researcher (research-analyst)
   │  ⎿  Research epistemic belief graphs
   └─ @latent-states-researcher (research-analyst)
      ⎿  Research latent belief states

● Three research agents are now running in parallel:

  1. benchmarks-researcher — Deep dive on Moltbook, RECAP, PRISM, LaMP, ToM
  benchmarks + finding additional relevant ones
  2. belief-graphs-researcher — Epistemic belief graphs, argumentation
  frameworks (ASPIC+, ArgRAG), disagreement compression from text
  3. latent-states-researcher — Latent belief states, Bayesian Nash Equilibrium,
   scaling laws for multi-agent debate

  Once all three complete, I'll spawn the synthesis agent (Task #4) to merge
  their findings into docs/3_1_exploration.md — a concise, opinionated decision
  document. I'll notify you when everything is ready.


@belief-graphs-researcher❯ Task #2 complete — belief graphs research done

● Good work from belief-graphs-researcher. Waiting on the other two agents
  (benchmarks + latent states) before kicking off synthesis.


@benchmarks-researc Benchmark research complete — key metrics and adoption
er❯                recommendations

● Two down, one to go. Benchmarks researcher delivered strong findings —
  especially the diversity-resolution frontier framing for a scaling law.
  Waiting on latent-states-researcher to complete before launching synthesis.


● Noted — benchmarks-researcher is idle. Still waiting on
  latent-states-researcher to finish Task #3.


● Still waiting on latent-states-researcher. The other two are idle and ready.


● Latent-states-researcher is still working. Let me check its progress.

● Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

● The file exists — latent-states-researcher has written its output. Let me
  check if it's complete.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● The latent-states researcher has finished writing. The file is complete and
  comprehensive. Let me mark task #3 complete and kick off the synthesis agent.

● All three research streams are done. Launching the synthesis agent now for
  Task #4 — it will read all three research files and produce the final
  docs/3_1_exploration.md.

● Agent(Synthesize research into exploration doc)

● Synthesis agent (Opus) is now running. It's reading all three research files
  plus existing architecture docs and will produce the final
  docs/3_1_exploration.md. I'll let you know when it's done.


@latent-states-rese Latent belief states research complete — API wall confirmed,
rcher❯              implementable path identified

● All three research agents have reported in. The synthesizer (Opus) is now
  working on merging everything into the final docs/3_1_exploration.md. Waiting
  on it to finish.


● Noted. All three researchers are idle. Synthesizer is still working — I'll
  share the result once it's done.


● Still waiting on the synthesizer.


@synthesizer❯ Synthesis doc complete, task #4 done

● Synthesis is done. Let me shut down the team and show you the result.

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Brewed for 43m 23s

● Done. Here's docs/3_1_exploration.md — the full synthesis. Let me clean up.

● Teammates are still shutting down. The document is ready though. Here's a
  summary of the key takeaways:

  ---
  The verdict across all four research streams:

  1. Scaling law — Not a theoretical law, but a defensible measurement 
  framework. The core claim: debate quality scales with epistemic divergence
  (measurable via belief vectors) up to a threshold. deltaSD (stance diversity
  post-debate) is the single most important metric — if it goes negative, your
  system is producing false consensus.
  2. Idea #1 (belief graphs) — Highest value. Build first. Offline extraction is
   validated (CausalRAG, KGGen). QBAF for crux extraction has public code
  (ArgLLMs/AAAI 2025) and replaces LLM-hallucinated crux cards with
  deterministic, auditable extraction. Everything else depends on this.
  3. Idea #2 (latent states) — True latent debate is dead with Claude API. But
  structured belief vectors (proposition confidence scores) are trivially
  implementable and provide the measurement layer needed for the scaling law.
  Their value is visibility, not generation quality.
  4. Idea #3 (community graph) — Visualization insight, not computational. Build
   as D3.js display layer on crux card data. Don't over-invest.
  5. Critical experiment: The self-consistency baseline (Wu et al.) could
  invalidate everything. If crux rooms don't beat single-agent resampling on the
   same metrics, the whole system is expensive self-consistency. Run this first.
  6. Build order: belief graphs → belief vectors → Tier 1 benchmarks → QBAF crux
   extraction.

  Full research details are in docs/research_benchmarks.md,
  docs/research_belief_graphs.md, and docs/research_latent_states.md.
