He claims programmability creates 'productive utility' that could shift coordination equilibria, but this fundamentally confuses a store of value with a technology platform. Gold doesn't compete with semiconductor manufacturing despite silicon's superior utility for computation—they serve different functions. Bitcoin's lack of programmability isn't a deficiency; it's the architectural choice that makes its monetary properties credible. Every additional feature is an additional attack surface that compromises the absolute scarcity thesis. Ethereum's complexity means its monetary policy can and has changed (the transition from POW to POS altered issuance), proving it cannot serve as the base layer store of value precisely because its 'superior bundle' requires ongoing governance that Bitcoin's simplicity eliminates.

Bitcoin has experienced contentious governance crises—the blocksize wars, Taproot activation debates, and ongoing discussions about covenant opcodes—that demonstrate governance is unavoidable in any living protocol. The difference is that Bitcoin's governance happens through social consensus and economic signaling rather than on-chain mechanisms, making it *less transparent* and *more vulnerable* to capture by mining cartels and core developer groups. Ethereum's on-chain governance and explicit roadmap make governance legible and contestable, which is precisely what long-term credibility requires. Confidence: 0.82",

Bitcoin's governance crises—blocksize wars, Taproot—resolved precisely because informal social consensus creates *higher* switching costs than formal mechanisms. When governance is expensive and contentious, monetary policy becomes credibly sticky. Ethereum's 'legible' governance enabled the DAO fork reversal and the PoS transition that altered issuance—both proving that explicit coordination mechanisms make monetary policy *less* credible over civilizational timescales because they lower the activation energy for change. The difficulty of changing Bitcoin is the feature that makes its 21 million cap trustworthy forever. Confidence: 0.95",
