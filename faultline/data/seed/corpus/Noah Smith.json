So here&#8217;s a roundup post with only one entry about AI. Just one, I promise! Well, OK, there&#8217;s also a podcast episode about AI. I went on the truly excellent Justified Posteriors podcast to talk about the economics of AI with Andrey Fradkin and Seth Benzell. It was truly a joy to do a podcast with people who know economics at a deep level! Justified Posteriors Noah Smith on Blogging, AI Economics, and Elite Overproduction We sit down with prominent blogger and economist Noah Smith to dig into the disconnect between AI hype and current macroeconomic reality. The central puzzle: if a &#8220;god machine&#8221; driving 20% annual GDP growth is truly imminent, why aren&#8217;t real interest rates skyrocketing as people borrow against a much wealthier future? Noah&#8217;s take is that markets are pri&#8230; Listen now 3 days ago &#183; 16 likes &#183; Andrey Fradkin and Seth Benzell Anyway, on to this week&#8217;s roundup. 1. Did AI cause a productivity boom in 2025? We don&#8217;t know. Erik Brynjolfsson believes that AI caused a productivity boom last year: Data released this week offers a striking corrective to the narrative that AI has yet to have an impact on the US economy as a whole&#8230;[N]ew figures reveal that total payroll growth [in 2025] was revised downward by approximately 403,000 jobs. Crucially, this downward revision occurred while real GDP remained robust, including a 3.7 per cent growth rate in the fourth quarter. This decoupling &#8212; maintaining high output with significantly lower labour input &#8212; is the hallmark of productivity growth&#8230;My own updated analysis suggests a US productivity increase of roughly 2.7 per cent for 2025. This is a near doubling from the sluggish 1.4 per cent annual average that characterised the past decade&#8230; Micro-level evidence further supports this structural shift. In",

What triggered it was seeing this tweet : Extreme tolerance of public disorder, and downplaying the importance of crime, is a hallmark of modern progressive American culture. There are plenty of Democrats who care about crime &#8212; Joe Biden recently tried to increase the number of police in America by a substantial amount &#8212; but there is constant pressure from the left against such measures. On social media, calls for greater public order are instantly met with accusations of racism and classism: (And this was far from the most radical post on the topic.) Nor is this attitude confined to anonymous radicals on social media. When Biden announced his Safer America Plan, the ACLU warned that putting more cops on the streets and punishing drug dealers would exacerbate racial disparities: [I]n this moment of fear and concern, the president must not repeat yesterday&#8217;s mistakes today. He calls for hiring 100,000 additional state and local police officers &#8211; the same increase in officers as the 1994 crime bill. This failed strategy did not make America safer, instead it resulted in massive over-policing and rampant rights violations in our communities&#8230;And while it is important that the president&#8217;s plan commits to fixing the racist sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, it regrettably also perpetuates the war on drugs by calling for harsh new penalties for fentanyl offenses. &#8220;While we are pleased with the president&#8217;s commitment to investing in communities, we strongly urge him not to repeat the grave errors of the 1990s &#8212; policies that exacerbated racial disparities, contributed to widespread police abuses, and created our current crisis of mass incarceration. The ACLU is very wrong about policing and crime &#8212; there&#8217;s very solid evidence that having more cops around reduces the amount of crim",

It&#8217;s not often one gets to live through an industrial revolution in real time, especially one that moves so quickly. There will be very few pieces of the economy &#8212; if any &#8212; that this revolution doesn&#8217;t touch, and it will have major implications for other things I write about (geopolitics, society, etc.). AI is not going to be a special, compartmentalized topic for a long time; it&#8217;s going to be central to a lot of what&#8217;s going on. If you find that boring, well, all I can say is, we don&#8217;t get to choose the times we live in. Anyway, today&#8217;s post is about the macroeconomics of AI, so that&#8217;s fun. I started out writing about macro long ago, and I haven&#8217;t really kept up with it in recent years. Every couple of weeks, someone comes out with a big post about how AI is changing everything, and the post goes viral and everyone talks about it for a few days. A couple of weeks ago it was Matt Shumer&#8217;s &#8220; Something Big is Happening &#8221;. This week it&#8217;s Citrini Research&#8217;s &#8220; THE 2028 GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE CRISIS &#8221; (yes, the title is in all caps): Citrini Research THE 2028 GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE CRISIS Preface&#8230; Read more 5 days ago &#183; 2338 likes &#183; 76 comments &#183; Citrini and Alap Shah The post paints a picture of a future in which AI disrupts lots of different kinds of white-collar work and service-industry business models in industries like software, finance, business services, and so on, and in which this disruption causes an economic crisis. This is really two theses in one &#8212; a microeconomic thesis about which industries and jobs AI will disrupt, and a macroeconomic thesis about what this will do to the economy overall. People are debating both. For a counterargument to the idea that AI is about to take all the w",

Kepper, 1908 In case you haven&#8217;t heard, the Supreme Court just ruled many of Donald Trump&#8217;s tariffs illegal : [T]he Supreme Court ruled that the unilaterally imposed [tariffs] were illegal&#8230;No longer does Trump have a tariff &#8220;on/off&#8221; switch&#8230;Future tariffs will need to be imposed by lengthy, more technical trade authorities &#8212; or through Congress&#8230; In a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court said that affirming Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) would \"represent a transformative expansion of the President's authority over tariff policy.\"&#8230;Chief Justice John Roberts said that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs because the Constitution grants Congress &#8212; and only Congress &#8212; the power to levy taxes and duties. This doesn&#8217;t mean that Trump&#8217;s tariffs are going to suddenly vanish. More are on the way. There are older laws passed by Congress in the 1960s and 1970s that authorize the President to raise tariffs under certain circumstances. Here&#8217;s a summary by the Yale Budget Lab: [T]he president has other sources of legal authority to enact tariffs without further congressional action. These authorities generally fall into two groups: those that require investigations by federal agencies but have few if any restrictions on the eventual tariffs imposed (Sections 201, 232, and 301) and Section 122, which provides a temporary authority to impose tariffs without an investigation, but is limited to a 15 percent rate for only 150 days. There is another authority, under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (otherwise known as Smoot-Hawley) that would allow the President to impose a 50 percent tariff with no investigation or time limitations, but no President has used this authority before, raising again concerns about future legal challenges. For now, all those other laws still stand, and Trump is going to use at least some of them. He imme",

We&#8217;ve done the dire warnings of doom , so now let&#8217;s be a little more pragmatic and optimistic. A friend called me up the other day and asked me what I thought Democrats could offer Americans in terms of economic policy in this day and age. We discussed the limitations of the progressive economic program that coalesced in the late 2010s and was implemented during the Biden years. We then talked about possibilities for how AI might affect the economy, and what Democrats could offer in various scenarios. I promised my friend I would write a post outlining my thoughts, so here you go. My basic argument is that the next Democratic policy offering should be robust to uncertainty . AI technology is changing very fast, and it will probably end up changing other technologies very quickly as well &#8212; robotics, energy, software, and so on. That rapid technological progress creates great uncertainty. Looking even just 10 years into the future, we basically don&#8217;t know: What kind of jobs humans will be doing (and which will pay well) What the macroeconomy &#8212; inflation, growth, and employment &#8212; is going to look like How the distributions of income and wealth will change Those are essentially all of the biggest questions in economics, and we don&#8217;t really know any of them. So what do you do when you can&#8217;t predict the future? You come up with ideas that will be likely to work no matter what the future ends up looking like. In other words, you try to be robust . AI is like a storm that&#8217;s buffeting the whole economy; Democrats need to be the rock in that storm. In fact, I have several ideas for how Democrats can create a robust economic offering even in the face of radical uncertainty. My three basic principles are: Abundance Government taking an ownership stake in the corporate system Policies to promote human work Before I talk about those, however, ",

The first kind is local &#8212; think air pollution and water pollution. This kind of activity hurts people who are geographically close by &#8212; when factories dump crap in the water, it&#8217;s local communities who get cancer, and so on. This kind of local pollution is typically solved by a local or national government, using things like regulation, pollution markets, and so on. In fact, humanity has a pretty good track record when it comes to problems like this. The Environmental Kuznets Curve &#8212; the theory that countries pollute less as they get richer &#8212; seems to hold true for air and water pollution. As people escape poverty, they demand a cleaner local environment. For example, China used to be known for its toxic, unbreathable air, but in the 2010s it launched a successful cleanup policy: Source: EPIC The second kind of environmental harm &#8212; global harm &#8212; is a lot harder to deal with. These are things that mostly hurt people in other countries &#8212; global warming being the primary example. It&#8217;s very hard to solve global warming, because the worldwide nature of the harm means there&#8217;s a free rider problem (or, if you prefer, a coordination problem) &#8212; no country wants to pay the full cost of decarbonization, because most of the benefit goes to people in other countries. You can try international agreements, but everyone has an incentive to cheat. Often, the best solution to these problems is technological &#8212; you simply invent something better and cheaper that doesn&#8217;t pollute as much, and then every country has an incentive to switch. Essentially, you use the positive externality of technology to fight the negative externality of pollution. This is what we did with HFC refrigerants, which replaced the CFCs that were destroying the ozone layer. It&#8217;s how we&#821",

Three years ago, shortly after the release of the original ChatGPT, I wrote a post about how LLMs are not going to destroy the human race: And just a couple of months ago, I wrote a post arguing that ASI (artificial superintelligence) is likely to peacefully coexist with humanity rather than kill us off. People wanted to know why my tone had shifted from optimistic to pessimistic. Well, the simple answer to that is &#8220;I was in a worse mood.&#8221; My rabbit was sick, 1 so I was kind of grumpy, and so in my post a few days ago I painted the eventual disempowerment of humanity as more of a negative thing than I usually do. In fact, I&#8217;ve always believed that at some point , humanity would be replaced with something posthuman &#8212; godlike AIs, a hive mind, modified humans, or whatever. I grew up reading science fiction about that kind of thing &#8212; Vernor Vinge, Charles Stross, Arthur C. Clarke, Iain M. Banks, and so on &#8212; and it just always seemed impossible that humanity had already attained the theoretical pinnacle of intelligence. 2 I had always simply envisioned that whatever came after us would be in the general human family , and would be more likely to be on our side than against us. That&#8217;s what my post the other day was about. I painted a more glum picture of humanity&#8217;s eventual supersession because I was in a bad mood. But even in that post, at the end, I offered optimism that ASI will save us from things like low fertility, fascist overlords, and the end of human-driven scientific discovery. That optimistic future would be like the Culture novels , by Iain M. Banks, in which AIs take the reins of civilization but in which they respect and help and protect a now-mostly-useless humanity &#8212; basically a much nicer, more enli",

It&#8217;s a time of dizzying technological change, and it&#8217;s easy to feel a lot of future shock right now. So I thought I&#8217;d repost something I wrote back in 2023 , when LLMs were just starting to have a big effect on the world. Reflecting on the changes in my lifetime, I realized that the internet, social media, smartphones, and other digital technologies had already altered the world of my childhood into something almost totally unrecognizable. AI is changing how we think, learn, and work, but the internet already wreaked deep, lasting, confusing changes on how we socialize with each other and how we present ourselves to the world. Humans are fundamentally social creatures, so to be honest I&#8217;m not sure which has been the more wrenching change (though of course AI is just getting started). Anyway, here&#8217;s the original post. In 1970, Alvin Toffler published Future Shock , a book claiming that modern people feel overwhelmed by the pace of technological change and the social changes that result. I&#8217;m starting to think that we ward off future shock by minimizing the scale and extent of the changes we experience in our life. I tend to barely notice the differences in my world from year to year, and when I do notice them they generally seem small enough to be fun and exciting rather than vast and overwhelming. Only when I look back on the long sweep of decades does it stun my just how much my world fails to resemble the one I grew up in. Back in March, Tyler Cowen wrote a widely read (and very good) piece about the rapid progress in generative AI. I agree that AI will change the world, usually in ways we&#8217;ve barely thought of yet. And I love Tyler&#8217;s conclusion that we should embrace the change and ride the wave instead of fearing it and trying to hold it back. B",

It was an accident; he was trying to bite a towel to move it out of his way, and I accidentally stuck my hand in his mouth. He is a gentle beast, and would never bite a human intentionally. Anyway, the bite punctured and lacerated my left index finger near the front knuckle. I washed it out, put some ointment and a band-aid on it, and that was that. It occurs to me that if my pet rabbit had instead been a tiger, I would now be dead. There is a reason most people don&#8217;t keep tigers as pets; they may be fluffy and cute, but they&#8217;re big and strong and can easily kill you . Instead, we generally keep pets who are smaller and weaker than us, allowing us to train them, and if necessary to physically restrain them, and minimizing the danger to our own health. Until now, we haven&#8217;t had to think about this principle in the context of intelligence. As long as you or I or anyone we know has been alive &#8212; for all of recorded history, and in fact for much much longer than that &#8212; humankind has been the most intelligent thing on this planet. At some point in the next couple of years, that will no longer be true. It arguably is no longer true right now.

First, here&#8217;s an episode of Econ 102 for you! As regular readers know, Econ 102&#8217;s regular run has ended due to my co-host getting extremely busy with his new job. But we will still come out with an episode every now and then. This episode is about how cameras can improve public safety &#8212; and whether they should: Anyway, on to this week&#8217;s list of interesting things. 1. Fixing public spaces is actually pretty easy The Bay Area Rapid Transit system (BART) is in a parlous state. Ridership has plummeted in recent years; it did not even come close to fully bouncing back after the pandemic. Source: Joey Politano If BART doesn&#8217;t get bailed out with higher taxes, it will have to close stations, reduce service, and lay off workers. Why did so many people stop riding BART? It&#8217;s possible that the pandemic permanently shifted people&#8217;s tastes; maybe people just got used to taking Uber or driving instead of using the train. But it&#8217;s also possible that the general increase in public disorder in the Bay Area just made BART unacceptable as a mode of transportation. It seemed like every train had its share of shady characters, drug users, vagrants, and the mentally ill. For a long time, everyone talked about this, but no one had the hard evidence to prove it. Well, now we do. After BART installed fare gates last year at many of its stations, crime on the trains plummeted by 54% in a single year . 1 What&#8217;s more, the amount of time that BART employees have to spend on &#8220;patron related Corrective Maintenance&#8221; &#8212; i.e., fixing or cleaning up things that riders break or defile &#8212; went from huge amounts to almost nothing: Source: BART It turns out that just a few riders were causing most of the disorder on the BART &#8212; and those riders were mostly not paying",

    "content": "from a photo by the Cabinet Public Affairs Office of Japan, CC BY 4.0 . Japan is a parliamentary democracy; they have a Prime Minister rather than a President. So when Takaichi Sanae became Prime Minister last October, it was because she won an internal party election, not because she received the mandate of the people. This was a problem for her, because her party &#8212; the Liberal Democratic Party (also known as Jiminto or the LDP), which is usually in power in Japan &#8212; didn&#8217;t actually have that strong of a majority. When their long-time coalition partner, a smaller party called Komeito, ditched the LDP after Takaichi came to power, some people thought Takaichi&#8217;s tenure in office might be cut short, or hamstrung by a lack of votes. So Takaichi did the smart but risky thing, which was to call a nationwide election. That election took place yesterday. The LDP proceeded to stomp all over the opposition, winning in a massive landslide . Takaichi&#8217;s party won 68% of the seats in the lower house, giving the LDP a 2/3 majority all by itself. That&#8217;s the biggest majority the LDP has ever had in its 71 years of existence &#8212; and when you add in its new coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, it&#8217;s now 76% . That means Takaichi can easily push through essentially any legislation she wants, except for a constitutional amendment (and those aren&#8217;t off the table either). 1 The Takaichi Era has now begun for real. Americans have taken a bit more of an interest in Japanese politics and society lately, probably because of the tourism boom. So I thought I&#8217;d try to explain what this all means. First, there&#8217;s the question of why the LDP always seems to win in Japan. Except for two brief periods out of power &#8212; in 1993 and 2009-2012 &#8212; the LDP has ruled Japan for the entire time since it came into existence in 1955. This almost unbroken run of victories has some people wondering if Japan is some kind of fake demo",

    "content": "\" Antifa (50840022832) \" by Chad Davis from United States , CC BY 2.0 These days it seems like the only things to write about are politics and AI. I wrote about AI last time, so today I&#8217;ll write about politics. Here is my basic theory of American politics in the 2020s: The United States is a nation of moderates ruled by a fringe of extremists. The extremists rule because they are more engaged than the moderates &#8212; they spend more time thinking about politics and doing political activism. In Martin Gurri&#8217;s terms , the extremists are the &#8220;public&#8221; and the moderates are the &#8220;populace&#8221;. There are several reasons why American politics is dominated by extremists. The well-known one is the closed-primary party system . Republicans win primaries not by aligning with the median voter, but by aligning with the median Republican voter &#8212; usually in an area that&#8217;s already right-leaning to begin with. The same is true of Democrats. But that has been true for a while. The fundamental reason why American politics is more extremist-dominated than in the past is technological . Modern social media bypasses traditional hierarchies and institutions and gathers together communities of like-minded extremists who then create challenges to traditional institutions; it also provides these extremists a platform in which their emotionally charged messages are more likely to go viral than messages of positivity and reason. The moderate majority increasingly avoids the politically charged, extremist-dominated online spaces. That gives lots of Americans more peace of mind, but it also means that online spaces become more and more extremist as moderates leave. 1 This is the conclusion of T&#246;rnberg (2025) : Using nationally representative data from the 2020 and 2024 American National Election Studies (ANES), this paper traces how the U.S. social media landscape has shifted&#8230; Overall platform use has declined, with the youngest and oldest",

It&#8217;s never possible to be sure why something like that happens &#8212; this selloff may even be irrational &#8212; but everyone seems to agree that it&#8217;s being driven by the fear that AI is rendering a bunch of software business models obsolete. Here&#8217;s Bloomberg : In the span of two days, hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off the value of stocks, bonds and loans of companies big and small across Silicon Valley. Software stocks were at the epicenter, plunging so much that the value of those tracked in an iShares ETF has now dropped almost $1 trillion over the past seven days&#8230; [T]his drubbing&#8230;was triggered [by] concern that AI is on the verge of supplanting the business models of a wide swathe of companies that doomsayers have long predicted were at risk&#8230; AI startup Anthropic PBC released a new tool for legal work, like reviewing contracts&#8230;The latest developments raise the specter that AI leaders will overtake established industry players in innovation.

The Democrats look increasingly likely to win at least the House of Representatives in the midterms &#8212; so likely that Trump is now panicking and starting his election denial routine early . But Trump shows signs of realizing that he overreached, demoting the head of the Border Patrol and making some other halting moves toward de-escalation . This is progress (at least if you dislike unaccountable secret police, race wars , warrantless searches , summary executions of protesters, and so on&#8230;which I do). But it&#8217;s possible that Democrats &#8212; and especially progressives &#8212; will take the wrong message from their first small victories in the battle against autocracy. For one thing, the Minnesota anti-ICE protests are starting to show some signs of being taken over by the same kind of radicals who made the 2020 BLM protests go overboard in Seattle, Portland, and a few other cities. Some protesters in Minneapolis are setting up illegal checkpoints to stop vehicles and screen them for ICE. Others have been harassing various people . Some leftist protesters have even denounced progressive activist Will Stancil , who was recently punched in the face . Obviously, if this kind of thing continues, all Trump and Stephen Miller and ICE will have to do is to back off and not kill any protesters for a while, and watch as the more extreme street activists reenact the ill-fated CHAZ from Seattle 2020. That would sap some (but not all) of the momentum from the backlash to the recent ICE killings. But the other danger is that Dems will take a midterm victory as a sign that they don&#8217;t need to recalibrate their position on the immigration issue. In a post two weeks ago , I pointed out that although they hate Trump&#8217;s heavy-handed tactics, Americans still don&#8217;t support the permissive immigration policies of the Biden years.",

In fact, although the dollar is holding its own against other national currencies , its share of global reserves is falling steeply once you bring gold into the picture: Source: Bloomberg via Lukas Ekwueme Bloomberg reports that governments and private investors are both buying gold at rapid rates, and that fear of the Trump administration&#8217;s policies is a big reason why&#8230;[T]he world may be preparing for a time of financial anarchy &#8212; an era in which the U.S. is no longer a safe haven and the dollar is no longer the reserve currency, but where China has chosen not to step up to fill the void, and Europe and other powers are unable to do so. A lot of people asked me whether gold&#8217;s rise as a share of reserves was due to people putting their money into gold, or to gold going up in price. In fact, those are the same thing. When demand increases for gold, it means that investors buy more gold, and it also means that the price goes up. 1 So basically, this all means that investors have been demanding more gold. Anyway, I thought that the idea of &#8220;international financial anarchy&#8221; was worth expanding on. A lot of people have this vague idea that the world&#8217;s finances are based on the U.S. dollar, but they don&#8217;t really know exactly what that means, and they don&#8217;t know what it would mean for the dollar to lose that status.

AI tech works, it&#8217;s going to be incredibly useful, and a lot of people are going to make enormous amounts of money off of it. Any bust would be a speed bump on the road to success.

In the meantime, I know you&#8217;d like something to read in the morning, so here&#8217;s a repost from a few years back. The big news out of China this past week wasn&#8217;t about electric cars or semiconductors or real estate. It was about Xi Jinping purging his top general (and close friend) Zhang Youxia, along with another top general named Liu Zhenli. No one knows exactly why this happened &#8212; I speculated about a coup plot in my weekly roundup, but most analysts don&#8217;t talk about that possibility. Here are three analyses that I found pretty interesting: Jon Czin (interviewed by Jordan Schneider) thinks Xi probably purged Zhang out of pure paranoia &#8212; Zhang was powerful and had a lot of people loyal to him, and Xi may have simply been afraid that Zhang could turn into a rival. Youlun Nie thinks Zhang simply wasn&#8217;t doing a good job getting the Chinese military ready for an invasion of Taiwan (and that this fact had been exposed by Zhang&#8217;s rivals, who were purged earlier). Xi may have simply decided to clean house and start afresh. K. Tristan Tang thinks Zhang simply didn&#8217;t want to get ready to invade Taiwan so quickly, and that Xi removed Zhang for resisting his orders. In the end we can&#8217;t really know. But it opens up the possibility that Xi is entering his &#8220;lion in winter&#8221; phase. Xi isn&#8217;t an organization-builder, like Mao, Lenin, Elon Musk, etc. He&#8217;s an organization- dominator , like Stalin &#8212; a guy who rises through the ranks of a big existing power structure by being very good at patronage, backstabbing, and various other power games.

First of all, it&#8217;s well known that I view China as both an economic and a geopolitical threat to the U.S.; I&#8217;ve repeatedly praised the U.S. export controls that stop China from buying American chips and chipmaking equipment. I&#8217;ve urged Europe to use trade barriers to make sure that sudden waves of subsidized Chinese goods don&#8217;t forcibly deindustrialize its economy. And when it comes to tariffs, I&#8217;ve argued that targeted tariffs on final consumption goods (e.g. cars) are less economically harmful and more effective than other kinds of tariffs. Given all of that, you wouldn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d write a post saying &#8220;America should buy Chinese cars after all.&#8221; Yet here we are. This post was precipitated by Canada&#8217;s decision to almost completely eliminate tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, as part of a trade deal: Under the arrangement, Canada will slash its tariff, currently 100%, to 6.1%, and allow Chinese electric vehicle imports of 49,000 units, rising to 70,000 over five years. Half of the annual quota is slotted for EVs costing less than CA$35,000. Beijing will also make a &#8220;considerable investment&#8221; in Canada&#8217;s auto sector over the next three years, Mr. Carney said. In return, China will slash its tariff on canola seed, one of Canada&#8217;s most important agricultural exports, from roughly 84 percent to about 15 percent. This is not part of a general free trade deal between China and Canada &#8212; it&#8217;s a targeted agreement. But politically, it&#8217;s a big break between Canada and the U.S. Back in 2024, when Biden imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, Canada followed suit &#8212; no doubt worried about losing its crucial American markets and displeasing its indispensable ally. Now, with Trump constantly threatening steep tariff",

    "content": "Howdy, folks! The theme of this week&#8217;s roundup is &#8220;self-inflicted harm by the world&#8217;s Great Powers&#8221;. I left Europe out of the mix this week, since their own improving growth, rearmament, decoupling from America, and successful pushback over Greenland makes them look a little less like a basket case. But the U.S., China, and Russia are each showing weakness in their own ways. For the U.S., the big problem is the MAGA ideology, which refuses to respect the law or interface with reality on many fronts. For China, the problem is Xi Jinping&#8217;s autocratic rule and the inevitable internal dissent this fosters. And of course for Russia, the problem is the Ukraine war. But I also note that India is being a lot smarter than the major powers, because it&#8217;s focusing on growth instead of on domestic disputes or dreams of empire. 1. The execution of Alex Pretti was totally predictable Just a couple of weeks after ICE agents gunned down Renee Good in her car, some other ICE agents just carried out an execution-style killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. There are plenty of videos, and here&#8217;s a detailed blow-by-blow of what happened (and here&#8217;s another if you want confirmation). Pretti was a protester who showed up with a holstered pistol, which is legal in Minnesota. He was filming ICE, and then went to help a woman who had been shoved by ICE agents. ICE tackled him to the ground, took away his gun, and then fired at least ten shots into Pretti, killing him. Stephen Miller immediately claimed that Pretti had been a terrorist intent on massacring ICE agents, while JD Vance blamed protesters and Democrats for the killing. But Americans are not fooled, and the administration may have made a tactical error by denying the existence of Second Amendment rights. Some GOP Senators are calling for an investigation into the killing. Meanwhile, this just builds on the wave of anger at ICE that followed the killing of Renee Good; already, a majori",

    "content": "Photo by NASA via Wikimedia Commons This past week, the world was treated to another fun and exciting episode of &#8220;Donald Trump almost wrecks the U.S. economy&#8221;. Trump escalated his threats to invade Greenland, causing the Danish territory to actually begin preparing for war . The U.S. President seemed to signal his seriousness by threatening to impose 10% tariffs on any European country that opposed his seizure of the island. That tariff rate by itself isn&#8217;t very high, but the fact that Trump was making the threat seemed to indicate that this time, his aggression was more than just bluster. Financial markets reacted sharply to the seeming seriousness of the latest threat. U.S. stock markets dropped sharply , the U.S. dollar fell in value , and U.S. Treasury yields rose . As CNBC reported, this was basically a &#8220;sell America&#8221; trade : The &#8220; sell America&#8221; trade is in full swing Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump and European leaders escalated tensions over Greenland &#8230;U.S. bond prices tumbled, sending yields spiking . The U.S. Dollar Index , which weighs the greenback against a basket of six foreign currencies, fell nearly 1%. The euro jumped 0.6% against the dollar&#8230;&#8220;This is &#8216;sell America&#8217; again within a much broader global risk off,&#8221; Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central banking strategy at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients. Trump responded by backing off, declaring that he wouldn&#8217;t use military force to seize Greenland: After a meeting with [NATO Secretary General Mark] Rutte on Wednesday, Trump called off promised tariffs on European nations, contending that he had &#8220;formed the framework of a future deal&#8221;&#8230;It was a stark shift in tone for Trump, who just days earlier had declined to rule out using the military to secure ownership of Greenland and posted an image online of the territory with an American flag plastered across it&#8230;Trump&#8230",
